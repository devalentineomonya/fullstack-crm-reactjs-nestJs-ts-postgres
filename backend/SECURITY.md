## Supported Versions

Given the project's current development status (v0.0.1), we recommend always using the latest commit from the `main` branch. Pre-release versions should not be used in production environments.

| Version | Supported          | Status       |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: | Development  |
| 0.0.x   | :x:                | Deprecated   |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### Private Disclosure Process
1. **Report Vulnerability**: Email testingdevalemail@gmail.com with:
   - Detailed description of vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
2. **Initial Response**: Within 48 business hours
3. **Verification**: Our team will investigate within 5 business days
4. **Patch Development**: Critical fixes prioritized within 7 days
5. **Public Disclosure**: Coordinated release after patch availability

### Security Best Practices
1. **Environment Protection**:
   ```env
   # Always keep these secret!
   JWT_SECRET=your_strong_secret_here
   SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
   ```
2. **Database Security**:
   - Use Row Level Security in Supabase
   - Limit service role key usage
   - Enable Supabase network restrictions

3. **API Protection**:
   - Implement rate limiting (future roadmap)
   - Validate all incoming DTOs
   - Use HTTPS in production

## Dependency Security

We maintain vigilance through:
```bash
pnpm audit # Regular security audits
```
![Dependency Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/dependencies-0%20vulnerabilities-brightgreen)

- **Critical Updates**: Patched within 24 hours
- **High Severity**: Patched within 72 hours
- **Medium/Low**: Addressed in regular releases

## Secure Development Practices

1. **Authentication**:
   - JWT tokens with short expiration times
   - Secure cookie storage for tokens
   - Password hashing via Supabase Auth

2. **Input Validation**:
   ```typescript
   // Example using class-validator
   @IsEmail()
   @MaxLength(255)
   email: string;
   ```

3. **Security Headers**:
   - Implement Helmet middleware
   - CORS restricted to trusted domains
   - Content Security Policy (CSP)

## Incident Response

1. **Critical Vulnerability**:
   - Immediate patch branch creation
   - Security advisory through GitHub
   - Supabase database rollback capability

2. **Breach Protocol**:
   - Rotate all secrets (JWT, Supabase keys)
   - Audit database access logs
   - Notify affected parties

**Note**: This project is currently in active development. Security practices will evolve with the maturity of the application. We recommend periodic security reviews for production implementations.
